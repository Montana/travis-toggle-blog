Balancing security and ease of use is important. Travis CI lets each team make decisions that fit specific needs.

It’s a given that collaboration happens at multiple levels when building software in Git repositories. One popular way of collaborating is to ‘fork’ an original repository and execute a ‘pull request’ (PR) against the original (i.e., ‘base’) repository. Employing a CI/CD tool in this scenario usually takes place as an automated check to see whether the changes proposed in the pull request from the fork will break anything in the base. However, in order for this to work, often the base repository must share some secret data with the fork, which could be abused by a malicious actor. 

Some teams wish to accept the risks and share these secrets, while some do not. Regardless of what is the best decision for your organization, we believe you deserve a choice. This is why we are excited to introduce new repository-level settings in Travis CI that allow repository owners and administrators to explicitly make this choice. 

For all repositories activated in Travis CI before March 1, 2022, the default repository-level settings around sharing [encrypted data](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/ and [Custom SSH Keys](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/private-dependencies/) will be set to:
* Non sharable encrypted environment variables with repository forks – please verify whether or not this suits your security preferences, particularly for public repositories.
* Sharable custom SSH keys (which may be present in private repositories) – this is done in order to help ensure build setups using forks from private repositories already in place do not break. 

All repositories activated in Travis CI after March 1, 2022 will have both settings set to OFF by default – after this change, organizations that wish to enhance collaboration by working with ‘forks’ by sharing some of the ‘base’ secrets or SSH keys will be required to explicitly enable these settings at the repository level in Travis CI. This will allow teams to change repository access for fork settings to fit their specific needs:

## Whom does this change affect?

If you have repositories activated in [travis-ci.com](https://app.travis-ci.com) before March 1, 2022 and are working with pull requests from forks, then no changes are necessarily required. However, you may still adjust repository settings whenever you wish. Please be aware of the potential risks to public repositories if you choose to keep this setting enabled. After March 1, 2022, if you wish to share encrypted secrets and/or SSH keys with forks in order to have pull requests from forks of a repository built as a part of your CI/CD procedures, you will need to adjust the repository-level settings. If you work with pull requests filed from branches of the repository instead of from forks, this change does not affect you.
